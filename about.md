Unexpected health problems in ourselves and family members are an unfortunate reality that can require extended time away from work.  Likewise, new parents need time to adjust to living with a baby in their home.  These issues affect everyone--men and women, rich and poor--alike, which is why federally mandated family leave programs are in place to protect the rights of workers when they need to take extended leave to care for themselves, a new child, or a sick loved one.  

Despite the benefits of paid leave programs for [employees](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/upshot/the-economic-benefits-of-paid-parental-leave.html) and [employers alike](http://www.wsj.com/articles/susan-wojcicki-paid-maternity-leave-is-good-for-business-1418773756), the United States remains the [only industrialized country](http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/paid-family-leave-obama-work) in the world that does not require employers provide paid leave programs, but this is changing. President Obama recently extended [6 weeks of paid leave](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/01/14/obama-to-propose-seven-days-paid-sick-leave-for-workers/) to federal employees and wants to expand those benefits. In the state of Washington, the FAMLI Act will provide income when workers must take extended leaves of up to 12 weeks for the birth or adoption of a child, or the serious health condition of the worker or a close family member, financed through low-cost payroll premiums. 

> Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. 

> - President Barrack Obama, [2015 State of the Union Address](http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/20/politics/state-of-the-union-2015-transcript-full-text/)

One way that companies benefit from paid leave programs is through reduction of turn-over costs associated with employee attitrition. Based on industry values, the attrition rate when no paid leave is offered is around 33%. That is, a third of those who take unpaid leave will not return to work once their leave is complete. While the effects of offering paid leave on attrition are not always easy to ascertain, we know that companies such as [Google](http://www.wsj.com/articles/susan-wojcicki-paid-maternity-leave-is-good-for-business-1418773756) have seen their attrition rate among new mothers halved after increasing paid leave to 18 weeks. This is where cost savings are generated. We created the benefits calculator so that people could explore the costs of paid and unpaid leave programs.

|                     | No Paid Leave | Paid Leave   |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Number taking leave |       12      |      12      |
| Number returning    |       8       |      10      |
| Number no returning | 4 (33%)       | 2 (17%)      |
| Cost of replacement | 4 x $169,064  | 2 x $169,064 |
| Cost of benefits    | $0            | 12 x $17,753 |
| Total costs         | $676,256      | $551,169     |
| Savings with paid leave | | $125,087     |


### Where do the values come from?

The Cost of Hire is a technology-specific number generated by [JDA Professional Services](http://www.jdapsi.com/Client/articles/coh), a staffing service specializing in the IT industry. For an employee with a salary of $60,000/yr, JDA estimates that the cost to replace is $150,000. As the salary of the position being replaces grows,
so does the cost of replacing the employee. Replacing an employee with an salary of $100,000/yr can cost as much as $169,000.  The cost of replacing an employee takes into account various direct and indirect expenses.  Among the costs that go into replacing an employee are the cost of the candidate search, relocation, sign-on bonuses, training, and the loss of institutional knowledge and productivity. Every enterprise is different, and some costs may be more applicable to some than to others, but the formula from JDA provides a solid starting point.

The tables below describe the costs accounted for in the calculator.

| Possible direct costs | | Dollars |
|------:|:-----|---------|
| *Job ads* | |
| | Develop description, write posting, get approvals, & post to job boards (5 hrs x $100/hr) | 500 | 
| | Run a 2-week ad on Monster | 100 | 
| | Handle/screen responses & schedule interviews (10 hrs x $100/hr) | 1,000 | 
| *Recruitment costs* | |
| | Interviewing costs (7 candidates x 3 hrs ea x $100/hr) | 2,100 | 
| | External recruiting fees (1.1*salary x 33%) | 22,176 | 
| | Pre-employment testing/reference check | 1,000 | 
| *Offer package* | |
| | Salary increase (salary x 10%) | 7,200 | 
| | Sign-on bonus (1.1*salary x 5%) | 3,360 | 
| | Relocation | 5,000 | 
| | Training (30 days x 2hrs/day x $100/hour + $1,000) | 7,000 | 
| **Total direct costs** | | **$49,436** | 

When an employee leaves a job, the company incurs direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are those that can be easily measured in dollars, *e.g.* the time required to post a job description or the cost of relocating a new hire.  Indirect costs are intangible and due to lost knowledge and productivity. These costs are hard to measure and many assumptions are implicit in their default values. The great thing about the benefits calculator is that you don't have to stick with our values. You can set your own exmpenses and explore how the costs change with different settings.  We work in technology so the technology industry was the focus of the tool.

| Possible indirect costs | Dollars |
|------:|:-----|
| Loss of training | $5,000 |
| Loss of institutional knowledge | $15,000 |
| Loss of productivity | $26,000 |
| Loss of morale in remaining employees | $18,924 |
| Additional stress on management | $12,000 |
| Consulting fees | $18,000 |
| Overtime expense| $5,640 |
| **Total inirect costs** | **$100,564** | 

### Simulating a workforce
 
When you change calculator values using the sliders, behind the scenes simulations compute the costs.  First, the salaries are randomly generated from a normal distribution based on the average salary you set. Of all your employees taking leave, a random subset are selected to not return and the proportion of non-returners varies depending on the benefits offered.  30 independent simulations are run every time you change a slider value and the costs are averaged across those simulations and visualized in the calculator. If you're interested in exploring the internals of the calculator, [download the R code](https://github.com/erinshellman/paid-leave-calculator) and explore for yourself.
